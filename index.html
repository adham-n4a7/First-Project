            <p> <b>Al-Masjid an-Nabawi</b> known in English as The Prophet's Mosque, and 
                also known as Al Haram, Al Haram Al Madani and Al Haram Al Nabawi by locals, 
                is a mosque built by the last Islamic Prophet <i>Muhammad (PBUH)</i> in the 
                city of Medina in the Al Madinah Province of Saudi Arabia. It was the second
                mosque built by Muhammad in Medina, after Masjid Quba'a, and is now one of the 
                largest mosques in the world. It is the second holiest site in Islam, after the 
                Masjid al-Haram in Mecca. The chamber adjacent to the Rawdah holds the tombs of
                Prophet Muhammad and two of his companions, father-in-laws and caliphs, Abu Bakr
                and  Umar ibn al-Khattab. A fourth grave is reserved for Isa (Jesus), as Muslims 
                believe that he will return and will be buried at the site. The site is covered
                by the Green Dome. It was constructed in 1817 CE during the reign of the Ottoman
                sultan Mahmud II and painted green in 1837 CE. </p>
